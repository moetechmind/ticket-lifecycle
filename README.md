</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">Communication</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Agent John sees this is Sev-A emergency ticket and has to reassign ticket to a System Administrator.
</p>
<p>
  He makes sure to leave a proper message:

<br />
<h3 align="center">Working the issue</h3>
<br />
<p>
  System Administrator agent Jane Doe logs in:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/i61WQKi.jpg" height="75%" width="100%" alt="Sys admin agent login"/>
</p>
<p>
  Agent Jane works the issue and communicates back to agent John.
</p>
<p>
  She also makes sure to switch the status of the issue from open to resolved:
</p>

</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">Resolution</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Support agent John sees in his portal that System Administrator agent Jane has left him a message and that the ticket is now closed:>

  In reality, the ticket lifecycle can be more complex. For instance:

Reassignment: A ticket might be reassigned to a different department if it's determined to be outside the initial team's scope (a network issue might be reassigned to the network team).
Escalation: Tickets can be escalated in severity if the issue is critical or impacting a large number of users. This might involve assigning the ticket to a senior technician or manager.
Reassignment and Escalation: In some cases, a ticket might need to be both reassigned to a different department and escalated due to the severity of the issue and the need for specialized expertise.
These are just a few examples of the variations that can occur within a typical ticket lifecycle.

Help desk agents can expect to manage a significant volume of tickets throughout their workday. Depending on the company size and complexity, this can range from 10 to 100 or more tickets per day.

I hope this provides a more comprehensive overview of the ticket lifecycle!
